Did you know that right now you can fight the biggest problems of our world?
With a simple strategy and good reasoning, you can help millions of
others without compromising the quality of your life.

**Come to Prague on December 10, 2016 to find out how at the first official
Czech conference on effective altruism - EAGxPrague 2016!**

# Programme

The conference will include talks by both Czech and foreign speakers
with impressive personal experience. Aside from formal talks, informal
discussions will be included. We wish to use these informal discussions
to foster debate about how to do good in our personal lifes and to bootstrap
a community of Czech effective altruists.

Catering will be supplied, including vegetarian and vegan options.

Applications will open soon.

we will let you know as soon as applications open, so you can be among

or at the [Czech EA group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/efektivnialtruismuscz/505083673035289/).

# Goals

The goal of our conference is to inform the Czech public about how can
we act to have *positive impact on the world*, and how can to guide
our actions in an *effective* manner. In other words: how to accomplish
*the most good with as little resources expended as possible*.
Making the world as good as possible as effectively as possible: that
is *effective altruism*.

We hope to use the EAGxPrague 2016 conference to reach everyone who
wants to benefit others in their life.
